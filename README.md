## Description

This project is an online music iPod, allowing users to listen to songs. However, please note that the number of available songs is currently limited. As the name suggests, this application mimics the functionality of an iPod, providing a user-friendly interface for music playback and navigation. Various gestures and functionalities are incorporated to enhance the user experience.

## Features

### Rotation Gesture / Rotation Detection

For detecting rotation gestures, ZingTouch, a JavaScript Gesture detection library, is employed.

### Menu-Bar

- To open or close the Menu-Bar, click on the Hamburger icon.
- Use rotation gesture on the circular-button to move upwards/downwards on the menu bar.
- Click the middle-circular-button to select an item on the menu-bar or to navigate to the selected page.
- To navigate to any page/screen, the menubar needs to be opened first, and then the select button (middle-circular-button) needs to be clicked on the page name.
- To go back from the musicPage to the menuPage, open the menu bar first, and then click the backward button.

### AllSongs Screen/Page

- Use "Forward(right)" and "Backward(left)" buttons to navigate from one song to another (the current song will have a different color).
- Use Play/Pause button to play and pause the currently selected song.
- If the song is playing, it will exhibit color animation.
